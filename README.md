The Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool designed to analyze public opinions, trends, and emotions expressed on Twitter. This project utilizes a dataset containing tweets labeled with sentiment categories, providing insights into customer feedback, brand perception, and social trends.
